Transmission

You are a car that a person is driving. They don't know how to change gears, only you do!
They'll put their foot on the gas or brake, and let's hope that the car knows how to do its stuff!


You'll be placed on the streets of Springfield (who knows what state!) and encounter stoplights, traffic, other cars, etc.

Haunted Transmission
You are just an ordinary adult human being driving to work, but as soon as you hop in your car, you realize you're not actually yourself, but rather the car itself!
Control the transmission as your human body decides to step on the gas or brakes of its own will.
Avoid unfortunate incidents with other cars, cyclists, squirrels, or stoplights.
Oh yeah, and don't be late to work!
