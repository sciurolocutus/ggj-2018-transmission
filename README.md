Haunted Transmission

You are just an ordinary adult human being driving to work, but as soon as you hop in your car, you realize you're not actually yourself, but rather the car itself!
Control the transmission as your human body decides to step on the gas or brakes of its own will.
Avoid unfortunate incidents with other cars, cyclists, squirrels, or stoplights.
Oh yeah, and don't be late to work!
